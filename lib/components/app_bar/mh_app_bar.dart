/// A material design app bar.
///
/// An app bar consists of a toolbar and potentially other widgets, such as a
/// [TabBar] and a [FlexibleSpaceBar]. App bars typically expose one or more
/// common [actions] with [IconButton]s which are optionally followed by a
/// [PopupMenuButton] for less common operations (sometimes called the "overflow
/// menu").
///
/// App bars are typically used in the [Scaffold.appBar] property, which places
/// the app bar as a fixed-height widget at the top of the screen. For a scrollable
/// app bar, see [SliverAppBar], which embeds an [AppBar] in a sliver for use in
/// a [CustomScrollView].
///
/// When not used as [Scaffold.appBar], or when wrapped in a [Hero], place the app
/// bar in a [MediaQuery] to take care of the padding around the content of the
/// app bar if needed, as the padding will not be handled by [Scaffold].
///
/// The AppBar displays the toolbar widgets, [leading], [title], and [actions],
/// above the [bottom] (if any). The [bottom] is usually used for a [TabBar]. If
/// a [flexibleSpace] widget is specified then it is stacked behind the toolbar
/// and the bottom widget. The following diagram shows where each of these slots
/// appears in the toolbar when the writing language is left-to-right (e.g.
/// English):
///
/// ![The leading widget is in the top left, the actions are in the top right,
/// the title is between them. The bottom is, naturally, at the bottom, and the
/// flexibleSpace is behind all of them.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/app_bar.png)
///
/// If the [leading] widget is omitted, but the [AppBar] is in a [Scaffold] with
/// a [Drawer], then a button will be inserted to open the drawer. Otherwise, if
/// the nearest [Navigator] has any previous routes, a [BackButton] is inserted
/// instead. This behavior can be turned off by setting the [automaticallyImplyLeading]
/// to false. In that case a null leading widget will result in the middle/title widget
/// stretching to start.
///
/// {@tool dartpad --template=stateless_widget_material}
///
/// This sample shows an [AppBar] with two simple actions. The first action
/// opens a [SnackBar], while the second action navigates to a new page.
///
/// ```dart preamble
